Where/when does the Middleware check, whether a certain module specified in the Configuration cannot be loaded by any runtime?

What if two Runtimes support the same Module Class?

Where is ModuleListResponse channels set? Because when it is sent in ServiceImpl::GetModuleList(...), the value is not set.

Am I initializing the Dart runtime in the ALEX_data_collection project correctly? I got a segfault because there was no entry for the dart runtime in
in the runtimeQueueMap. I had to add it manually. However, this entry should have been set during InitRuntime.
