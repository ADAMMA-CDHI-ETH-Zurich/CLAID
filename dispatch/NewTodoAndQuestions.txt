Questions:
    - Currently, in GetModuleList(), the middleware always returns ALL modules in ModuleListResponse. Not only the Modules per runtime.
        - The ModuleDispatcher of each runtime then has to ignore all the modules it cannot support?
    - Where/when does the Middleware check, whether a certain module specified in the Configuration cannot be loaded by any runtime?

    - Where is ModuleListResponse channels set? Because when it is sent in ServiceImpl::GetModuleList(...), the value is not set.
    - Am I initializing the Dart runtime in the ALEX_data_collection project correctly? I got a segfault because there was no entry for the dart runtime in
    in the runtimeQueueMap. I had to add it manually. However, this entry should have been set during InitRuntime.

    (- What if two Runtimes support the same Module Class? -> this is checked in GetModuleList as far as I can tell)

Todo:
- How to do Dart <-> UI integration? What if Activity get's destroyed, but service is still running -> how to restart the activity and display data from CLAID channels
- Java
    - Java ModuleDispatcher implementation
    - Java tests
- encryption
    - encryption of data types (in rest, e.g., when writing to internal storage)
    - encryption for remote communication (grpc credentials)
- Remove hardcoding of socket path -> each CLAID application should have it's own directory to store the socket, which should not be readable by other Apps
    - for Android / iOS, that's easy -> just store in App local data or documents directory
    - How to do this safely on Linux/macOS ? (+ Windows, but that's an optional path of pain)
- test infrastructure, code coverage, ... -> tests involving multiple languages?
- Automatically generate device ID?

Longterm todos:
- Python integration
- iOS bazel targets and testing
- (decision for) Windows support
