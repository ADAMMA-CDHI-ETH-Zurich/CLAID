A Flutter plugin to use the CLAID framework. CLAID is a flexible and modular framework enabling seamless deployment of **machine learning models** and **data collection modules** across various devices and operating systems. Deploy your existing python machine learning pipelines on mobile devices and connect data streams from sensors in a plug-and-play approach using simple configuration files!

CLAID allows to build applications for mobile (Android, WearOS, iOS*) and regular (Linux, macOS) operating systems, enabling seamless communication between individual Modules implemented in different programming languages (C++, Dart, Java, Python, Objective-C) running on all these operating systems. Existing CLAID Modules allow to effortlessly implement modular machine learning and data collection applications with little-to-no coding. For more details, check out the <a href="https://claid.ethz.ch">CLAID website</a> and our <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X24002589?via%3Dihub">publication</a>.

CLAID is developed and maintained by the <a href="https://c4dhi.org">Centre for Digital Health Interventions</a> at ETH Zurich.

## Features
- Seamless deployment of machine learning projects across mobile, edge and cloud devices
  - Deploy your existing ML code in python directly on Android and even WearOS devices!
  - Plug-in native Sensor Modules (accelerometer, location sensors, audio, ...) or external wearables (smartwatches, spirometer, ...) and connect the data streams directly to Python code for analysis!
- Seamless communication between Modules running on different operating systems or implemented in different programming languages, allowing various devices to be integrated into an edge-cloud system
  - Support for Android, WearOS, Linux and macOS (iOS support in the making)
  - Support for C++, Dart, Java, Python and Objective-C
- Pre-created Modules ready to use without programming, which can be loaded, configured and combined from simple configuration files:
  - Modules for data collection on Android, WearOS and iOS
  - Modules for data serialization, storage and upload
  - Modules to execute machine learning models (e.g., using Python directly on-device, or alternatively using TensorFlowLite) 
- Long-running and stable background operation via services on Android and WearOS (30+ days uptime without interrupt on Android 13+)
- Full device management features on Android and WearOS, enabling to control Wifi/Bluetooth from the background (without user intervention), preventing termination and uninstallation of Apps (useful for digital biomarker studies)
- Encryption in rest and in-transit (soon) of data sent via a network or stored locally

## Our research
<div align="justify"> 
CLAID is driven by our <strong>Digital Biomarker Research</strong>. In the field of Digital Biomarkers, we use mobile devices like Smartphones, Wearables, and Bluetooth Peripherals to gather datasets for training Machine Learning-based Digital Biomarkers. We observed a lack of tools to repurpose our data collection applications for real-world validation of our research projects. CLAID offers a unified solution for both data collection and integration of trained models, closing a critical gap in Digital Biomarker research.</div>
