# CLAID - Closing the Loop on AI & Data Collection: Flutter Package
<div align="justify"> 
A pip package containing the Python implementation of CLAID (PyCLAID). CLAID is a flexible and modular middleware framework based on transparent computing. CLAID allows to build applications for mobile (Android, WearOS, iOS*) and regular (Linux, macOS) operating systems, enabling seamless communication between individual Modules implemented in different programming languages (C++, Java, Dart, Python) running on all these operating systems. Existing CLAID Modules allow to effortlessly implement modular machine learning and data collection application with little-to-no coding.  For more details, check out the <a href="https://claid.ethz.ch">CLAID website</a> and our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05643">publication</a>.

CLAID is developed and maintained by the <a href="https://c4dhi.org">Centre for Digital Health Interventions</a> at ETH Zurich.

## Features
- Seamless communication between Modules running on different OS or implemented in programming languages, allowing different devices to be integrated into an edge-cloud system
  - Support for Android, WearOS, Linux and macOS (iOS support in the making)
  - Support for C++, Java, Dart and Python*
- Pre-created Modules ready to use without programming, which can be loaded, configured and combined from simple configuration files:
  - Modules for data collection on Android and WearOS
  - Modules for data serialization, storage and upload
  - Modules to execute machine learning models (currently using TensorFlowLite) 
- Background operating via services on Android and WearOS
- Encryption in rest and in-transit (soon) of data sent via a network or stored locally


<p><small style="color: grey;">*pip package will be released separately</small></p>


## Our research
<div align="justify"> 
CLAID is driven by our <strong>Digital Biomarker Research</strong>. In the field of Digital Biomarkers, we use mobile devices like Smartphones, Wearables, and Bluetooth Peripherals to gather datasets for training Machine Learning-based Digital Biomarkers. We observed a lack of tools to repurpose our data collection applications for real-world validation of our research projects. CLAID offers a unified solution for both data collection and integration of trained models, closing a critical gap in Digital Biomarker research.</div>
